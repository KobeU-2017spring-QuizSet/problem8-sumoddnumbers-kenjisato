# Introduction

In this exercise, we will compute sum of odd numbers in an array. On `R`, you can check wheter a number is odd or prime by `%`.

```{r}
 a = 4
 b = 7

 a%%2
 b%%2
```

if `x%%2` returns `1`, x is an odd number.

# Question
- you have an array `OS <- as.integer(runif(100, min = 1, max = 99))`
- write a code to sum the odd numbers in `OS`
- wirte a short code as you can do

# Solution

```{r}
OS <- as.integer(runif(100, min = 1, max = 99))
sum(OS[OS %% 2 == 1])
```
